#FLOAT

Our group project for BITS (Building IT Systems) at RMIT

This is a basic 2d scroller game with a balloon dog as the player character.
The background continuously scrolls and the goal is to jump over and crouch under obstacles.

There is a high score board to keep track of personal bests. Your score increases over time the longer you last.
There will be collectable power ups such as invincibility and speed boost, which will increase your score further.
